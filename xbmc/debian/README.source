A script is used to generate the orig source that is to be distributed with
Debian. The script can be found at
https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc-packaging/blob/master/xbmc-get-orig-source

The '--minimal' option is passed to the script to remove non-free libraries as
well as libraries and other code not needed to build XBMC for Linux.
