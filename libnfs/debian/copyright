Libnfs components fall under two separate licences


The lib and include directories
===============================
The nfs client library itself, i.e. the lib and include directories,
is licenced under GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

The src and examples directories
================================
The utility and example applications using this library, i.e. the src and the
examples directories, are licenced under the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the
License, or (at your option) any later version.


To avoid any confusion, every source file contains a licence boilerplate
